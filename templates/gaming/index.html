          Video games were traditionally enjoyed on sophisticated game consoles or expensive desktop PCs. Increasingly, gaming experiences are becoming mobile, spontaneous and casual. This change is driven by the proliferation of smartphones, broadband internet access and the cloud.

        <p>
          With the cloud providing a high-performance and scalable computing backend for games, video streaming is emerging as an attractive distribution channel. Game streaming from the cloud does away with expensive devices. Gamers can play games hosted in the cloud on any smartphone, laptop or tablet with an identical experience as more expensive consoles.

    <h2>Cloud games for Android </h2>
    <p>With over three million apps, the Android operating system has the most extensive  inventory of games with one of the largest existing ecosystems of developers. Running Android games in the cloud, and delivering them via streaming, levels the playing field for hardware. There is no need for the latest and greatest smartphones to be able to enjoy the most exciting gaming experiences. Rich graphical rendering becomes accessible even to low end smartphones. Game discovery becomes simple, with a Netflix-like experience. Gamers play on demand, on the go, with less battery drain than ever.</p>
    <p>What does it take to realise this vision? As one can imagine, this would first and foremost require scalable virtualisation capabilities for Android in the cloud. Furthermore, virtualisation should occur in a way that supports hardware acceleration for high-quality and high-speed video encoding for streaming purposes. Finally, for commercial-grade deployments, manageability, reliability and security will be required. The key challenges are:</p>
    <ul class="p-list">
      <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">High density for attractive unit economics</li>
      <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">Software automation for low cost operations</li>
      <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">Commercial-grade support for reliability</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Anbox Cloud is engineered to address these challenges. The commercially supported platform builds on open source software to empower innovators to stream Android games at scale in the cloud.</p>

      <h3>Android in containers</h3>
      <p>Unlike Android emulators that make use of virtual machines, Anbox Cloud leverages system containers through <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/">LXD</a>, the next generation system container manager. It offers a user experience similar to virtual machines but using lightweight Linux containers instead manageable via a REST API. It also exposes GPUs through a passthrough. You will therefore take advantage of any hardware accelerators to deliver rich mobile experiences.</p>

This involves streaming servers, image repositories, applications, a dashboard application for management and <a href="https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/overview">more</a>.
