          The Android platform hosts the largest ecosystem of mobile applications, with over 3 millions titles in the app store. With overcrowded app stores, mobile application developers compete intensively for app real estate on user mobile devices.

      </div>
      <div class="col-6">
        <p>
          When making decisions regarding what apps to download, users evaluate the quality of apps. This quality is sometimes reflected by the experience of other users with the app, as expressed in app store reviews. As a result, users converge to high quality apps and defect from apps with quality flaws.
        </p>
        <p>
          Extensive testing is the condition for quality. With the growing complexity of mobile applications, manual testing alone can not deliver the level of quality assurance expected by users. Only test automation the level of test coverage required for a modern mobile app. Furthermore, automation reduces the cost of testing, while it accelerates time to market, since it allows to spot bugs and fix them faster.

    <h2>Mobile device virtualisation</h2>
    <p>
      Quality expectations from mobile application users are always increasing. Mobile application publishers need to raise their quality checking practices to the highest standards in order to compete. Perfect quality assurance requires rigorous and exhaustive application testing. This means testing complex mobile applications in every detail. This also means exhaustive testing with every change of code to avoid regressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore these cases have to be representative of the real usage scenarios. For mobile devices test representativeness will involve integration of sensors like cameras, microphones, GPS, NFC etc. The variability in mobile form factors must also be taken into account, with factors such as different screen sizes. Most importantly, to be viable, test operations need to be affordable from an OPEX and CAPEX point of view.
    </p>
    <p>
      What does it take to achieve these goals? As one can imagine, this would first and foremost require scalable virtualisation capabilities for Android in the cloud. Furthermore, the virtualisation platform should be integrated with existing CI/CD infrastructure. Finally APIs need to be available to drive test automation. Therefore key challenges are:
    </p>
    <ul class="p-list">
      <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">Android virtualisation</li>
      <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">Integration in CD/CD pipeline</li>
      <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">Automatisation APIs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Anbox Cloud is engineered to address these challenges. The commercially supported platform builds on open source software to empower innovators to test Android applications at scale in the cloud.

      <h3>Android in containers</h3>
      <p>Unlike Android emulators that make use of virtual machines, Anbox Cloud leverages system containers through <a class="p-link--external" href="https://linuxcontainers.org/">LXD</a>. LXD is a next generation system container manager. It offers a user experience similar to virtual machines but using lightweight Linux containers instead manageable via a REST API. You will therefore take advantage of automation-friendly interfaces to streamline your CI/CD testing pipeline.</p>
