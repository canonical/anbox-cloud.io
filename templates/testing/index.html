          Mobile app complexity is growing, requiring broad test coverage to ensure app quality. However, developers currently lack options to automate Android app testing at scale. Anbox Cloud enables CI/CD test automation in the cloud for Android apps.

          The Android platform hosts the largest ecosystem of mobile applications, with over three million titles in the app store. With crowded app stores, mobile applications compete for visibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users evaluate the quality of apps when deciding which one to download. Based on app store search algorithms, quality is reflected by app store reviews. This means that users converge to the best rated apps.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only extensive testing ensures app quality. Manual testing alone can not deliver the stellar quality expected by users. Automation reduces the cost of testing and accelerates time to market as it helps find bugs and you can fix them faster.

    <h2>Test apps on Android</h2>
    <p>
      Quality expectations from users are constantly increasing. Mobile application publishers need to raise their quality checking practices to higher standards to compete. Quality assurance requires testing complex mobile applications in every detail. This means exhaustive testing with every change of code to avoid regressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatâ€™s more, test cases have to be representative of the real usage scenarios. Testing needs to use  sensors like cameras, microphones, GPS, NFC, etc. Tests should cover various mobile form factors, taking variables like different screen sizes into account. Most importantly, to be viable, test operations need to be affordable from an OPEX and CAPEX point of view.
    </p>
    <p>
      What does it take to achieve these goals? Scalable virtualisation capabilities for Android in the cloud are required first and foremost. Furthermore, the virtualisation platform should be integrated with existing CI/CD infrastructure. Finally APIs need to be available to drive test automation. The key challenges are:
    </p>
    <ul class="p-list">
      <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">Android virtualisation</li>
      <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">Integration in CD/CD pipeline</li>
      <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">Automatisation APIs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Anbox Cloud is engineered to address these challenges. The commercially supported platform builds on open source software to empower innovators to test Android applications at scale in the cloud.

      <h3>Android in containers</h3>
      <p>Unlike Android emulators that make use of virtual machines, Anbox Cloud leverages system containers through <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/">LXD</a>, the next generation system container manager. Offering a user experience similar to virtual machines but using lightweight Linux containers instead, it is  managed via a REST API. You can take advantage of automation-friendly interfaces to streamline your CI/CD testing pipeline.</p>
